# ip grabber
Simple program to get the ip address of a program. Needs to be run on the computer. You can do that by maybe phishing.  
  
The "unix&linux.sh" runs on macOS/OS X and Linux. The "windows.bat" runs on Windows. Please note that on the "unix&linux.sh" file must be given executuble permission with "`chmod +x unix&linux.sh`".
  
There are two different files because each runs natively on their respectives operating systems.
